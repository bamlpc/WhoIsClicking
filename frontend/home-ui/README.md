# Comfort React template:

This is a basic structure that I made because I was experimenting with react and I hate to create a whole react app from sratch every time.

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).
